## Edit Code

<!-- todo -->

You can ask Cody to perform code edits using the Edit Code command. This will edit code according to your instructions, giving you the chance to retry the edit with a new prompt, undo, accept, or reject the change(s).

To get started: select code in your editor, right click, and choose "Cody → Edit Code".

You can also use the default keyboard shortcut of `Opt+K`/`Alt+K`.

**✨ Pro-tips for code editing with Cody**
<br>• You can open the 💡 menu, with an "Cody: Edit Code" option, by selecting any line of code and using the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+.`/`Ctrl+.`.
<br>• If you start an empty line and open the 💡 menu (using the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+.`/`Ctrl+.`) you can use "Cody: Generate Code" to generate new lines of code based on instructions.
<br>• You define your own custom code editing commands using [Custom Commands (Beta)](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody/custom-commands), by setting the [`commands.<id>.mode` property](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody/capabilities/commands#commands-id-mode).
