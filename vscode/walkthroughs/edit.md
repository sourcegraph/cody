## Edit Code

<!-- todo -->

You can ask Cody to perform code edits using the Edit Code command. This will edit code according to your instructions, giving you the chance to retry the edit with a new prompt, undo, accept, or reject the change(s).

To get started: select code in your editor, right click, and choose "Cody â†’ Edit Code".

You can also use the default keyboard shortcut of `Opt+K`/`Alt+K`.
