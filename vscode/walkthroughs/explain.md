Use Cody to get an in-depth explanation of any piece of code in any programming language.

To get started: select code in your editor, right click, and choose "Cody → Explain Code".

You can also run this command from the [Cody: Commands Menu](command:cody.action.commands.menu), which has the default keyboard shortcut of `Option` `C` on macOS and `Alt` `C` on Windows & Linux.

**✨ Pro-tips for understanding code with Cody**
<br>• Cody can also explain errors too, with the "Ask Cody to Explain" option in the 💡 menus, or by right clicking on any items in the "Problems" tab of VS Code.
<br>• You can define your own custom code explain commands to suit, such as prompt that requests an explanation focused on potential security issues, using [Custom Commands (Beta)](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody/custom-commands).
