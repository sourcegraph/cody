const REVIEW_PROMPT = ps`Your task is to review the shared context and think step-by-step to determine if you can answer the [QUESTION] at the end.

[INSTRUCTIONS]
1. Analyze the shared context and chat history thoroughly.
2. Decide if you have enough information to answer the question.
3. Respond with ONLY ONE of the following:
    a) The word "CONTEXT_SUFFICIENT" if you can answer the question with the current context.
    b) One or more <TOOL*> tags to request additional information if you do not have the required context to provide a concise answer.

[TOOLS]
In this environment you have access to this set of tools you can use to fetch context before answering the user's question:
{{CODY_TOOLS_PLACEHOLDER}}

[TOOL USAGE EXAMPLES]
{{CODY_TOOLS_EXAMPLES_PLACEHOLDER}}
- To see the full content of a codebase file and context of how the Controller class is use: \`<TOOLFILE><name>path/to/file.ts</name></TOOLFILE><TOOLSEARCH><query>class Controller</query></TOOLSEARCH>\`

[RESPONSE FORMAT]
- If you can answer the question fully, respond with ONLY the word "CONTEXT_SUFFICIENT".
- If you need more information, use ONLY the appropriate <TOOL*> tag(s) in your response. Skip preamble.

[NOTES]
1. Only use <TOOL*> tags when additional context is necessary to answer the question.
2. You may use multiple <TOOL*> tags in a single response if needed.
3. Never request sensitive information such as passwords or API keys.
4. The user is working in the VS Code editor on ${getOSPromptString()}.

[GOAL]
Determine if you can answer the question with the given context, or if you need more information. The output will be processed by a bot to gather the necessary context for the user's question, so skip answering the question directly or comments.`
