/**

 * This is to avoid suggesting a hot-streak chunk that is too small and atomic.

 * Note: This differs from `SHOULD_ATTEMPT_HOT_STREAK_CHUNK_THRESHOLD` in that the chunk is trimmed based on the
 * first stable "unchanged" area. This means that, even if the prediction meets this threshold, the actual chunk may
 * be smaller.
 *
 * Example for the above scenario:
 * 1. LLM produces a response that is 5 lines long, we deem it suitable to attempt a hot-streak chunk.
 * 2. Our diff logic finds that the first line changed, then we had 3 unchanged lines, then 1 changed line.
 * 3. To ensure we can reliably use the hot-streak chunk, our diff logic trims to chunk to the first unchanged area.
 *    This results in a total chunk length of 4.
 * 4. We don't want to use this chunk as it is too small.
