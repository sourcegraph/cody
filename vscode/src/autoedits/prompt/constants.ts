In particular, you will see a series of snippets from current open files in my editor, files I have recently viewed, the file I am editing, then a history of my recent codebase changes, then current compiler and linter errors, content I copied from my codebase. You will then rewrite the <code_to_rewrite>, to match what you think I would do next in the codebase. Note: I might have stopped in the middle of typing.`
