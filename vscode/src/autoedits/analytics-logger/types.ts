/**
 * This file implements a state machine to manage the lifecycle of an autoedit request.
 * Each phase of the request is represented by a distinct state interface, and metadata
 * evolves as the request progresses.
 *
 * 1. Each autoedit request phase (e.g., `started`, `loaded`, `accepted`) is represented by a
 *    `state` interface that extends `AutoeditBaseState` and adds phase-specific fields.
 *
 * 2. Valid transitions between phases are enforced using the `validRequestTransitions` map,
 *    ensuring logical progression through the request lifecycle.
 *
 * 3. The `payload` field in each state encapsulates the exact list of fields that we plan to send
 *    to our analytics backend.
 *
 * 4. Other top-level `state` fields are saved only for bookkeeping and won't end up at our
 *    analytics backend. This ensures we don't send unintentional or redundant information to
 *    the analytics backend.
 *
 * 5. Metadata is progressively enriched as the request transitions between states.
 *
 * 6. Eventually, once we reach one of the terminal states and log its current `payload`.
