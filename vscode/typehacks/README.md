These are additional "type" definitions that can enforce correct usage of certain APIs within the context of our Cody plugin.

These hacks are not part of the normal tsconfig as they would pollute the global scope. They are similarly done written as `ts` not `d.ts` files as Typescript does not respect excludes for `d.ts` files and any import in another project would include the typehacks (unless skipLibCheck=true).
