    TypeScript code _must_ use paths to import other TypeScript code. Paths
    _may_ be relative, i.e. starting with `.` or `..`, or rooted at the base

    Code _should_ use relative imports (`./foo`) rather than absolute imports
    `path/to/foo` when referring to files within the same (logical) project as
    this allows to move the project around without introducing changes in these
    imports.

    Both namespace and named imports can be used.


    Prefer named imports for symbols used frequently in a file or for symbols
    that have clear names, for example Jasmine's `describe` and `it`. Named
    imports can be aliased to clearer names as needed with `as`.


    Prefer namespace imports when using many different symbols from large APIs.
    A namespace import, despite using the `*` character, is not comparable to a
    wildcard import as seen in other languages. Instead, namespace imports give
    a name to all the exports of a module, and each exported symbol from the
    module becomes a property on the module name. Namespace imports can aid
    readability for exported symbols that have common names like `Model` or
    `Controller` without the need to declare aliases.


    // Bad: overlong import statement of needlessly namespaced names.

    import {Item as TableviewItem, Header as TableviewHeader, Row as
    TableviewRow,
      Model as TableviewModel, Renderer as TableviewRenderer} from './tableview';

    Three examples where renaming can be helpful:

    -   If the imported symbol name is generated.

    -   If importing symbols whose names are unclear by themselves, renaming can

    Use named exports in all code:


    // Use named exports:

    export class Foo { ... }


    ```


    Do not use default exports. This ensures that all imports follow a uniform
    pattern.


    // Do not use default exports:

    export default class Foo { ... } // BAD!


    ```


    Why?


    Default exports provide no canonical name, which makes central maintenance
    difficult with relatively little benefit to code owners, including
    potentially decreased readability:


    ```ts

    import Foo from './bar';  // Legal.

    import Bar from './bar';  // Also legal.

    ```


    Named exports have the benefit of erroring when import statements try to
    import something that hasn't been declared. In `foo.ts`:


    ```ts

    const foo = 'blah';

    export default foo;

    ```


    And in `bar.ts`:


    ```ts

    import {fizz} from './foo';

    ```


    Results in `error TS2614: Module '"./foo"' has no exported member 'fizz'.`
    While `bar.ts`:


    ```ts

    import fizz from './foo';

    ```


    Results in `fizz === foo`, which is probably unexpected and difficult to
    debug.


    Additionally, default exports encourage people to put everything into one
    big object to namespace it all together:


    ```ts

    export default class Foo {
      static SOME_CONSTANT = ...
      static someHelpfulFunction() { ... }
      ...
    }

    ```


    With the above pattern, we have file scope, which can be used as a
    namespace. We also have a perhaps needless second scope (the class `Foo`)
    that can be ambiguously used as both a type and a value in other files.


    Instead, prefer use of file scope for namespacing, as well as named exports:


    ```ts

    export const SOME_CONSTANT = ...

    export function someHelpfulFunction()

    export class Foo {
      // only class stuff here
    }

    Regardless of technical support, mutable exports can create hard to
    understand and debug code, in particular with re-exports across multiple
    modules. One way to paraphrase this style point is that `export let` is not
    allowed.


    ```ts

    export let foo = 3;

    // In pure ES6, foo is mutable and importers will observe the value change
    after a second.

    // In TS, if foo is re-exported by a second file, importers will not see the
    value change.

    window.setTimeout(() => {
      foo = 4;
    }, 1000 /* ms */);

    ```


    If one needs to support externally accessible and mutable bindings, they
    _should_ instead use explicit getter functions.


    let foo = 3;

    window.setTimeout(() => {
      foo = 4;
    }, 1000 /* ms */);

    // Use an explicit getter to access the mutable export.

    export function getFoo() { return foo; };


    ```


    For the common pattern of conditionally exporting either of two values,
    first do the conditional check, then the export. Make sure that all exports
    are final after the module's body has executed.


    function pickApi() {
      if (useOtherApi()) return OtherApi;
      return RegularApi;
    }

    export const SomeApi = pickApi();

    You may use `import type {...}` when you use the imported symbol only as a
    type. Use regular imports for values:


    import type {Foo} from './foo';

    import {Bar} from './foo';


    import {type Foo, Bar} from './foo';


    ```


    Why?


    The TypeScript compiler automatically handles the distinction and does not
    insert runtime loads for type references. So why annotate type imports?


    The TypeScript compiler can run in 2 modes:


    -   In development mode, we typically want quick iteration loops. The
    compiler transpiles to JavaScript without full type information. This is
    much faster, but requires `import type` in certain cases.

    -   In production mode, we want correctness. The compiler type checks
    everything and ensures `import type` is used correctly.


    Note: If you need to force a runtime load for side effects, use `import
    '...';`. See

    Use `export type` when re-exporting a type, e.g.:


    export type {AnInterface} from './foo';


    ```


    Why?


    `export type` is useful to allow type re-exports in file-by-file
    transpilation. See [`isolatedModules`
    docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#exports-of-non-value-identifiers).


    `export type` might also seem useful to avoid ever exporting a value symbol
    for an API. However it does not give guarantees, either: downstream code
    might still import an API through a different path. A better way to split &
    guarantee type vs value usages of an API is to actually split the symbols
    into e.g. `UserService` and `AjaxUserService`. This is less error prone and
    also better communicates intent.

    TypeScript supports two methods to organize code: _namespaces_ and
    _modules_, but namespaces are disallowed. That is, your code _must_ refer to
    code in other files using imports and exports of the form `import {foo} from
    'bar';`


    Your code _must not_ use the `namespace Foo { ... }` construct. `namespace`s
    _may_ only be used when required to interface with external, third party
    code. To semantically namespace your code, use separate files.


    Code _must not_ use `require` (as in `import x = require('...');`) for
    imports. Use ES6 module syntax.


    // Bad: do not use namespaces:

    namespace Rocket {
      function launch() { ... }
    }


    // Bad: do not use <reference>

    /// <reference path="..."/>


    // Bad: do not use require()

    import x = require('mydep');


    ```


    NB: TypeScript `namespace`s used to be called internal modules and used to
    use the `module` keyword in the form `module Foo { ... }`. Don't use that
    either. Always use ES6 imports.

    const [a, b, c, ...rest] = generateResults();

    let [, b,, d] = someArray;


    ```


    Destructuring may also be used for function parameters. Always specify `[]`
    as the default value if a destructured array parameter is optional, and

    kept as simple as possible: a single level of unquoted shorthand properties.
    Deeper levels of nesting and computed properties may not be used in
    parameter destructuring. Specify any default values in the left-hand-side of
    the destructured parameter (`{str = 'some default'} = {}`, rather than
    `{str} = {str: 'some default'}`), and if a destructured object is itself
    optional, it must default to `{}`.


    Example:


    interface Options {
      /** The number of times to do something. */
      num?: number;

      /** A string to do stuff to. */
      str?: string;
    }


    function destructured({num, str = 'default'}: Options = {}) {}

    Code _must not_ use `this` in a static context.


    JavaScript allows accessing static fields through `this`. Different from
    other languages, static fields are also inherited.


    class ShoeStore {
      static storage: Storage = ...;

      static isAvailable(s: Shoe) {
        // Bad: do not use `this` in a static method.

    Why?


    This code is generally surprising: authors might not expect that static
    fields can be accessed through the this pointer, and might be surprised to
    find that they can be overridden - this feature is not commonly used.


    This code also encourages an anti-pattern of having substantial static

    It is unnecessary to provide an empty constructor or one that simply

    Properties used from outside the lexical scope of their containing class,
    such as an Angular component's properties used from a template, _must not_
    use `private` visibility, as they are used outside of the lexical scope of
    their containing class.


    Use either `protected` or `public` as appropriate to the property in
    question. Angular and AngularJS template properties should use `protected`,
    but Polymer should use `public`.


    TypeScript code _must not_ use `obj['foo']` to bypass the visibility of a
    property.


    Why?


    When a property is `private`, you are declaring to both automated systems
    and humans that the property accesses are scoped to the methods of the
    declaring class, and they will rely on that. For example, a check for unused
    code will flag a private property that appears to be unused, even if some
    other file manages to bypass the visibility restriction.


    Though it might appear that `obj['foo']` can bypass visibility in the
    TypeScript compiler, this pattern can be broken by rearranging the build
    rules, and also violates [optimization
    compatibility](#optimization-compatibility).

    Getters and setters, also known as accessors, for class members _may_ be
    used. The getter method _must_ be a [pure
    function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) (i.e., result is
    consistent and has no side effects: getters _must not_ change observable
    state). They are also useful as a means of restricting the visibility of
    internal or verbose implementation details (shown below).


    class Foo {
      constructor(private readonly someService: SomeService) {}

      get someMember(): string {
        return this.someService.someVariable;
      }

      set someMember(newValue: string) {
        this.someService.someVariable = newValue;
      }
    }


    ```


    class Foo {
      nextId = 0;
      get next() {
        return this.nextId++; // Bad: getter changes observable state
      }
    }


    ```


    If an accessor is used to hide a class property, the hidden property _may_
    be prefixed or suffixed with any whole word, like `internal` or `wrapped`.
    When using these private properties, access the value through the accessor
    whenever possible. At least one accessor for a property _must_ be
    non-trivial: do not define pass-through accessors only for the purpose of
    hiding a property. Instead, make the property public (or consider making it
    `readonly` rather than just defining a getter with no setter).


    class Foo {
      private wrappedBar = '';
      get bar() {
        return this.wrappedBar || 'bar';
      }

      set bar(wrapped: string) {
        this.wrappedBar = wrapped.trim();
      }
    }


    ```


    class Bar {
      private barInternal = '';
      // Neither of these accessors have logic, so just make bar public.
      get bar() {
        return this.barInternal;
      }

      set bar(value: string) {
        this.barInternal = value;

    Event handlers _may_ use arrow functions when there is no need to uninstall
    the handler (for example, if the event is emitted by the class itself). If
    the handler requires uninstallation, arrow function properties are the right
    approach, because they automatically capture `this` and provide a stable
    reference to uninstall.


    // Event handlers may be anonymous functions or arrow function properties.

    class Component {
      onAttached() {
        // The event is emitted by this class, no need to uninstall.
        this.addEventListener('click', () => {
          this.listener();
        });
        // this.listener is a stable reference, we can uninstall it later.
        window.addEventListener('onbeforeunload', this.listener);
      }
      onDetached() {
        // The event is emitted by window. If we don't uninstall, this.listener will
        // keep a reference to `this` because it's bound, causing a memory leak.
        window.removeEventListener('onbeforeunload', this.listener);
      }
      // An arrow function stored in a property is bound to `this` automatically.
      private listener = () => {
        confirm('Do you want to exit the page?');
      }
    }


    ```


    Do not use `bind` in the expression that installs an event handler, because
    it creates a temporary reference that can't be uninstalled.


    // Binding listeners creates a temporary reference that prevents
    uninstalling.

    class Component {
      onAttached() {
        // This creates a temporary reference that we won't be able to uninstall
        window.addEventListener('onbeforeunload', this.listener.bind(this));
      }
      onDetached() {
        // This bind creates a different reference, so this line does nothing.
        window.removeEventListener('onbeforeunload', this.listener.bind(this));
      }
      private listener() {
        confirm('Do you want to exit the page?');

    TypeScript code _may_ use the `String()` and `Boolean()` (note: no `new`!)
    functions, string template literals, or `!!` to coerce types.


    const bool = Boolean(false);

    const str = String(aNumber);

    const bool2 = !!str;

    const str2 = `result: ${bool2}`;


    ```


    Values of enum types (including unions of enum types and other types) _must
    not_ be converted to booleans with `Boolean()` or `!!`, and must instead be
    compared explicitly with comparison operators.


    enum SupportLevel {
      NONE,
      BASIC,
      ADVANCED,
    }


    const level: SupportLevel = ...;

    let enabled = Boolean(level);


    const maybeLevel: SupportLevel|undefined = ...;

    enabled = !!maybeLevel;

    enum SupportLevel {
      NONE,
      BASIC,
      ADVANCED,
    }


    const level: SupportLevel = ...;

    let enabled = level !== SupportLevel.NONE;


    const maybeLevel: SupportLevel|undefined = ...;

    enabled = level !== undefined && level !== SupportLevel.NONE;


    ```


    Why?


    For most purposes, it doesn't matter what number or string value an enum
    name is mapped to at runtime, because values of enum types are referred to
    by name in source code. Consequently, engineers are accustomed to not
    thinking about this, and so situations where it _does_ matter are
    undesirable because they will be surprising. Such is the case with
    conversion of enums to booleans; in particular, by default, the first
    declared enum value is falsy (because it is 0) while the others are truthy,
    which is likely to be unexpected. Readers of code that uses an enum value
    may not even know whether it's the first declared value or not.


    Using string concatenation to cast to string is discouraged, as we check
    that operands to the plus operator are of matching types.


    Code _must_ use `Number()` to parse numeric values, and _must_ check its
    return for `NaN` values explicitly, unless failing to parse is impossible
    from context.


    Note: `Number('')`, `Number(' ')`, and `Number('\t')` would return `0`
    instead of `NaN`. `Number('Infinity')` and `Number('-Infinity')` would
    return `Infinity` and `-Infinity` respectively. Additionally, exponential
    notation such as `Number('1e+309')` and `Number('-1e+309')` can overflow
    into `Infinity`. These cases may require special handling.


    const aNumber = Number('123');

    if (!isFinite(aNumber)) throw new Error(...);


    ```


    Code _must not_ use unary plus (`+`) to coerce strings to numbers. Parsing
    numbers can fail, has surprising corner cases, and can be a code smell
    (parsing at the wrong layer). A unary plus is too easy to miss in code
    reviews given this.


    const x = +y;


    ```


    Code also _must not_ use `parseInt` or `parseFloat` to parse numbers, except
    for non-base-10 strings (see below). Both of those functions ignore trailing
    characters in the string, which can shadow error conditions (e.g. parsing

    12

    dwarves

    ``` as `12`).


    const n = parseInt(someString, 10);  // Error prone,

    const f = parseFloat(someString);    // regardless of passing a radix.


    ```


    Code that requires parsing with a radix _must_ check that its input contains
    only appropriate digits for that radix before calling into `parseInt`;


    if (!/^[a-fA-F0-9]+$/.test(someString)) throw new Error(...);

    // Needed to parse hexadecimal.

    // tslint:disable-next-line:ban

    const n = parseInt(someString, 16);  // Only allowed for radix != 10


    ```


    Use `Number()` followed by `Math.floor` or `Math.trunc` (where available) to
    parse integer numbers:


    let f = Number(someString);

    if (isNaN(f)) handleError();

    f = Math.floor(f);


    ```

    while (!!foo) {...}

    const foo: MyInterface|null = ...;

    if (foo) {...}

    while (foo) {...}

    [As with explicit conversions](#type-coercion), values of enum types
    (including unions of enum types and other types) _must not_ be implicitly
    coerced to booleans, and must instead be compared explicitly with comparison
    operators.

    Other types of values may be either implicitly coerced to booleans or
    compared explicitly with comparison operators:


    // Explicitly comparing > 0 is OK:

    if (arr.length > 0) {...}

    // so is relying on boolean coercion:

    statement groups (`case ...`) _must not_ fall through (enforced by the
    compiler):


    switch (x) {
      case X:
        doSomething();
        // fall through - not allowed!
      case Y:
        // ...
    }


    ```


    Empty statement groups are allowed to fall through:


    switch (x) {
      case X:
      case Y:
        doSomething();
        break;
      default: // nothing to do.

    Type assertions (`x as SomeType`) and non-nullability assertions (`y!`) are
    unsafe. Both only silence the TypeScript compiler, but do not insert any
    runtime checks to match these assertions, so they can cause your program to
    crash at runtime.


    Because of this, you _should not_ use type and non-nullability assertions
    without an obvious or explicit reason for doing so.


    Instead of the following:


    (x as Foo).foo();


    y!.bar();


    ```


    When you want to assert a type or non-nullability the best answer is to
    explicitly write a runtime check that performs that check.


    // assuming Foo is a class.

    if (x instanceof Foo) {
      x.foo();
    }


    if (y) {
      y.bar();
    }


    ```


    Sometimes due to some local property of your code you can be sure that the
    assertion form is safe. In those situations, you _should_ add clarification
    to explain why you are ok with the unsafe behavior:


    // x is a Foo, because ...

    (x as Foo).foo();


    // y cannot be null, because ...

    y!.bar();


    ```


    If the reasoning behind a type or non-nullability assertion is obvious, the
    comments _may_ not be necessary. For example, generated proto code is always
    nullable, but perhaps it is well-known in the context of the code that
    certain fields are always provided by the backend. Use your judgement.

    From the [TypeScript
    handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-assertions),
    TypeScript only allows type assertions which convert to a _more specific_ or
    _less specific_ version of a type. Adding a type assertion (`x as Foo`)
    which does not meet this criteria will give the error: Conversion of type
    'X' to type 'Y' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps
    with the other.


    If you are sure an assertion is safe, you can perform a _double assertion_.
    This involves casting through `unknown` since it is less specific than all
    types.


    // x is a Foo here, because...

    (x as unknown as Foo).fooMethod();


    ```


    Use `unknown` (instead of `any` or `{}`) as the intermediate type.

    Decorators are syntax with an `@` prefix, like `@MyDecorator`.

    We generally want to avoid decorators, because they were an experimental
    feature that have since diverged from the TC39 proposal and have known bugs

    When using decorators, the decorator _must_ immediately precede the symbol

    /** JSDoc comments go before decorators */

    @Component({...})  // Note: no empty line after the decorator.

    class MyComp {

    TypeScript code can use either `undefined` or `null` to denote absence of a

    Nullable aliases typically indicate that null values are being passed around

    original issue that resulted in `null`. They also make it unclear when
    specific values on a class or interface might be absent.


    Instead, code _must_ only add `|null` or `|undefined` when the alias is
    actually used. Code _should_ deal with null values close to where they
    arise, using the above techniques.

    In addition, TypeScript supports a special construct for optional parameters
    and fields, using `?`:


    interface CoffeeOrder {
      sugarCubes: number;
      milk?: Whole|LowFat|HalfHalf;
    }


    function pourCoffee(volume?: Milliliter) { ... }


    ```


    Optional parameters implicitly include `|undefined` in their type. However,
    they are different in that they can be left out when constructing a value or
    calling a method. For example, `{sugarCubes: 1}` is a valid `CoffeeOrder`
    because `milk` is optional.


    Use optional fields (on interfaces or classes) and parameters rather than a
    `|undefined` type.


    For classes preferably avoid this pattern altogether and initialize as many
    fields as possible.


    class MyClass {
      field = '';
    }

    TypeScript's type system is structural, not nominal. That is, a value
    matches a type if it has at least all the properties the type requires and
    the properties' types match, recursively.


    When providing a structural-based implementation, explicitly include the
    type at the declaration of the symbol (this allows more precise type
    checking and error reporting).


    const foo: Foo = {
      a: 123,
      b: 'abc',
    }


    ```


    const badFoo = {
      a: 123,
      b: 'abc',
    }


    ```


    Use interfaces to define structural types, not classes


    interface Foo {
      a: number;
      b: string;
    }


    const foo: Foo = {
      a: 123,
      b: 'abc',
    }


    ```


    class Foo {
      readonly a: number;
      readonly b: number;
    }


    const foo: Foo = {
      a: 123,
      b: 'abc',
    }


    ```


    Why?


    The badFoo object above relies on type inference. Additional fields could be
    added to badFoo and the type is inferred based on the object itself.


    When passing a badFoo to a function that takes a Foo, the error will be at
    the function call site, rather than at the object declaration site. This is
    also useful when changing the surface of an interface across broad
    codebases.


    ```ts

    interface Animal {
      sound: string;
      name: string;
    }


    function makeSound(animal: Animal) {}


    /**
     * 'cat' has an inferred type of '{sound: string}'
     */
    const cat = {
      sound: 'meow',
    };


    /**
     * 'cat' does not meet the type contract required for the function, so the
     * TypeScript compiler errors here, which may be very far from where 'cat' is
     * defined.
     */
    makeSound(cat);


    /**
     * Horse has a structural type and the type error shows here rather than the
     * function call.  'horse' does not meet the type contract of 'Animal'.
     */
    const horse: Animal = {
      sound: 'niegh',
    };


    const dog: Animal = {
      sound: 'bark',

    TypeScript supports [type
    aliases](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-aliases)
    for naming a type expression. This can be used to name primitives, unions,
    tuples, and any other types.


    However, when declaring types for objects, use interfaces instead of a type
    alias for the object literal expression.


    interface User {
      firstName: string;
      lastName: string;
    }


    ```


    type User = {
      firstName: string,
      lastName: string,
    }


    ```


    Why?


    These forms are nearly equivalent, so under the principle of just choosing
    one out of two forms to prevent variation, we should choose one.
    Additionally, there are also [interesting technical reasons to prefer
    interface](https://ncjamieson.com/prefer-interfaces/). That page quotes the
    TypeScript team lead: Honestly, my take is that it should really just be
    interfaces for anything that they can model. There is no benefit to type
    aliases when there are so many issues around display/perf.

    For simple types (containing just alphanumeric characters and dot), use the
    syntax sugar for arrays, `T[]` or `readonly T[]`, rather than the longer
    form `Array<T>` or `ReadonlyArray<T>`.


    For multi-dimensional non-`readonly` arrays of simple types, use the syntax
    sugar form (`T[][]`, `T[][][]`, and so on) rather than the longer form.


    For anything more complex, use the longer form `Array<T>`.


    These rules apply at each level of nesting, i.e. a simple `T[]` nested in a
    more complex type would still be spelled as `T[]`, using the syntax sugar.


    let a: string[];

    In JavaScript, it's common to use an object as an associative array (aka
    map, hash, or dict). Such objects can be typed using an [index
    signature](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html#index-signatures)
    (`[k: string]: T`) in TypeScript:


    const fileSizes: {[fileName: string]: number} = {};

    fileSizes['readme.txt'] = 541;


    ```


    In TypeScript, provide a meaningful label for the key. (The label only
    exists for documentation; it's unused otherwise.)


    const users: {[key: string]: number} = ...;


    ```


    const users: {[userName: string]: number} = ...;


    ```


    Rather than using one of these, consider using the ES6 `Map` and `Set` types
    instead. JavaScript objects have [surprising undesirable
    behaviors](http://2ality.com/2012/01/objects-as-maps.html) and the ES6 types
    more explicitly convey your intent. Also, `Map`s can be keyed by—and `Set`s
    can contain—types other than `string`.


    TypeScript's builtin `Record<Keys, ValueType>` type allows constructing
    types with a defined set of keys. This is distinct from associative arrays
    in that the keys are statically known. See advice on that
    [below](#mapped-conditional-types).

    TypeScript's [mapped
    types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html) and
    [conditional
    types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html)
    allow specifying new types based on other types. TypeScript's standard
    library includes several type operators based on these (`Record`, `Partial`,
    `Readonly` etc).


    These type system features allow succinctly specifying types and
    constructing powerful yet type safe abstractions. They come with a number of
    drawbacks though:


    -   Compared to explicitly specifying properties and type relations (e.g.
    using interfaces and extension, see below for an example), type operators
    require the reader to mentally evaluate the type expression. This can make
    programs substantially harder to read, in particular combined with type
    inference and expressions crossing file boundaries.

    -   Mapped & conditional types' evaluation model, in particular when
    combined with type inference, is underspecified, not always well understood,
    and often subject to change in TypeScript compiler versions. Code can
    accidentally compile or seem to give the right results. This increases
    future support cost of code using type operators.

    -   Mapped & conditional types are most powerful when deriving types from
    complex and/or inferred types. On the flip side, this is also when they are
    most prone to create hard to understand and maintain programs.

    -   Some language tooling does not work well with these type system
    features. E.g. your IDE's find references (and thus rename property
    refactoring) will not find properties in a `Pick<T, Keys>` type, and Code
    Search won't hyperlink them.


    The style recommendation is:


    -   Always use the simplest type construct that can possibly express your
    code.

    -   A little bit of repetition or verbosity is often much cheaper than the
    long term cost of complex type expressions.

    -   Mapped & conditional types may be used, subject to these considerations.


    For example, TypeScript's builtin `Pick<T, Keys>` type allows creating a new
    type by subsetting another type `T`, but simple interface extension can
    often be easier to understand.


    interface User {
      shoeSize: number;
      favoriteIcecream: string;
      favoriteChocolate: string;
    }


    // FoodPreferences has favoriteIcecream and favoriteChocolate, but not
    shoeSize.

    type FoodPreferences = Pick<User, 'favoriteIcecream'|'favoriteChocolate'>;


    ```


    This is equivalent to spelling out the properties on `FoodPreferences`:


    interface FoodPreferences {
      favoriteIcecream: string;
      favoriteChocolate: string;
    }


    ```


    To reduce duplication, `User` could extend `FoodPreferences`, or (possibly
    better) nest a field for food preferences:


    interface FoodPreferences { /* as above */ }

    interface User extends FoodPreferences {
      shoeSize: number;
      // also includes the preferences.
    }


    ```


    Using interfaces here makes the grouping of properties explicit, improves
    IDE support, allows better optimization, and arguably makes the code easier
    to understand.

    The `any` type allows assignment into any other type and dereferencing any

    `unknown` in that situation — it expresses the concept and is much safer as
    it does not allow dereferencing arbitrary properties.


    // Can assign any value (including null or undefined) into this but cannot

    The `{}` type, also known as an _empty interface_ type, represents a

    player = {
      health: 50,

    Google3 code **should not** use `{}` for most use cases. `{}` represents any
    non-nullish primitive or object type, which is rarely appropriate. Prefer
    one of the following more-descriptive types:


    -   `unknown` can hold any value, including `null` or `undefined`, and is
    generally more appropriate for opaque values.

    -   `Record<string, T>` is better for dictionary-like objects, and provides
    better type safety by being explicit about the type `T` of contained values
    (which may itself be `unknown`).

    -   `object` excludes primitives as well, leaving only non-nullish functions
    and objects, but without any other assumptions about what properties may be
    available.

    Do not use `@ts-ignore` nor the variants `@ts-expect-error` or
    `@ts-nocheck`.


    Why?


    They superficially seem to be an easy way to fix a compiler error, but in
    practice, a specific compiler error is often caused by a larger problem that
    can be fixed more directly.


    For example, if you are using `@ts-ignore` to suppress a type error, then
    it's hard to predict what types the surrounding code will end up seeing. For
    many type errors, the advice in [how to best use `any`](#any) is useful.


    You may use `@ts-expect-error` in unit tests, though you generally _should
    not_. `@ts-expect-error` suppresses all errors. It's easy to accidentally
    over-match and suppress more serious errors. Consider one of:


    -   When testing APIs that need to deal with unchecked values at runtime,
    add casts to the expected type or to `any` and add an explanatory comment.
    This limits error suppression to a single expression.

    -   Suppress the lint warning and document why, similar to [suppressing
    `any` lint warnings](#any-suppress).

    Use `/** JSDoc */` comments to communicate information to the users of your
    code. Avoid merely restating the property or parameter name. You _should_
    also document all properties and methods (exported/public or not) whose
    purpose is not immediately obvious from their name, as judged by your
    reviewer.


    **Exception:** Symbols that are only exported to be consumed by tooling,
    such as @NgModule classes, do not require comments.

    Method descriptions begin with a verb phrase that describes what the method
    does. This phrase is not an imperative sentence, but instead is written in
    the third person, as if there is an implied This method ... before it.

    A [parameter
    property](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#parameter-properties)
    is a constructor parameter that is prefixed by one of the modifiers
    `private`, `protected`, `public`, or `readonly`. A parameter property
    declares both a parameter and an instance property, and implicitly assigns
    into it. For example, `constructor(private readonly foo: Foo)`, declares
    that the constructor takes a parameter `foo`, but also declares a private
    readonly property `foo`, and assigns the parameter into that property before
    executing the remainder of the constructor.


    To document these fields, use JSDoc's `@param` annotation. Editors display
    the description on constructor calls and property accesses.


    /** This class demonstrates how parameter properties are documented. */

    class ParamProps {
      /**
       * @param percolator The percolator used for brewing.
       * @param beans The beans to brew.
       */
      constructor(
        private readonly percolator: Percolator,
        private readonly beans: CoffeeBean[]) {}
    }


    ```


    /** This class demonstrates how ordinary fields are documented. */

    class OrdinaryClass {
      /** The bean that will be used in the next call to brew(). */
      nextBean: CoffeeBean;

      constructor(initialBean: CoffeeBean) {
        this.nextBean = initialBean;
      }
    }

    JSDoc type annotations are redundant in TypeScript source code. Do not
    declare types in `@param` or `@return` blocks, do not write `@implements`,
    `@enum`, `@private`, `@override` etc. on code that uses the `implements`,
    `enum`, `private`, `override` etc. keywords.

    For non-exported symbols, sometimes the name and type of the function or
    parameter is enough. Code will _usually_ benefit from more documentation
    than just variable names though!


    -   Avoid comments that just restate the parameter name and type, e.g.

        ```ts
        /** @param fooBarService The Bar service for the Foo application. */
        ```

    -   Because of this rule, `@param` and `@return` lines are only required
    when they add information, and _may_ otherwise be omitted.

        ```ts
        /**
         * POSTs the request to start coffee brewing.
         * @param amountLitres The amount to brew. Must fit the pot size!
         */
        brew(amountLitres: number, logger: Logger) {
          // ...
        }
        ```

    “Parameter name” comments should be used whenever the method name and
    parameter value do not sufficiently convey the meaning of the parameter.


    Before adding these comments, consider refactoring the method to instead
    accept an interface and destructure it to greatly improve call-site
    readability.


    Parameter name comments go before the parameter value, and include the
    parameter name and a `=` suffix:


    someFunction(obviousParam, /* shouldRender= */ true, /* name= */ 'hello');


    ```


    Existing code may use a legacy parameter name comment style, which places
    these comments ~after~ the parameter value and omits the `=`. Continuing to
    use this style within the file for consistency is acceptable.


    someFunction(obviousParam, true /* shouldRender */, 'hello' /* name */);

    When a class, method, or property have both decorators like `@Component` and
    JsDoc, please make sure to write the JsDoc before the decorator.


    -   Do not write JsDoc between the Decorator and the decorated statement.

        ```ts
        @Component({
          selector: 'foo',
          template: 'bar',
        })
        /** Component that prints "bar". */
        export class FooComponent {}
        ```

    -   Write the JsDoc block before the Decorator.

        ```ts
        /** Component that prints "bar". */
        @Component({
          selector: 'foo',
          template: 'bar',
        })
        export class FooComponent {}
        ```

    For any style question that isn't settled definitively by this
    specification, do what the other code in the same file is already doing (be
    consistent). If that doesn't resolve the question, consider emulating the
    other files in the same directory.


    Brand new files _must_ use Google Style, regardless of the style choices of
    other files in the same package. When adding new code to a file that is not
    in Google Style, reformatting the existing code first is recommended,
    subject to the advice [below](#reformatting-existing-code). If this
    reformatting is not done, then new code _should_ be as consistent as
    possible with existing code in the same file, but _must not_ violate the
    style guide.

    You will occasionally encounter files in the codebase that are not in proper
    Google Style. These may have come from an acquisition, or may have been
    written before Google Style took a position on some issue, or may be in
    non-Google Style for any other reason.


    When updating the style of existing code, follow these guidelines.


    -   It is not required to change all existing code to meet current style
    guidelines. Reformatting existing code is a trade-off between code churn and
    consistency. Style rules evolve over time and these kinds of tweaks to
    maintain compliance would create unnecessary churn. However, if significant
    changes are being made to a file it is expected that the file will be in
    Google Style.

    -   Be careful not to allow opportunistic style fixes to muddle the focus of
    a CL. If you find yourself making a lot of style changes that aren’t
    critical to the central focus of a CL, promote those changes to a separate
    CL.
