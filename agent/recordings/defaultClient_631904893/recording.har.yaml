                  Below is the code from file path src/sum.ts. Review the code
                  outside the XML tags to detect the functionality, formats,
                  style, patterns, and logics in use. Then, use what you detect
                  and reuse methods/libraries to complete and enclose completed
                  code only inside XML tags precisely without duplicating
                  existing implementations. Here is the code:

                  I am Cody, an AI coding assistant from Sourcegraph. I'm here
                  to help you with coding questions and provide you with code
                  insights. I'm not able to participate in non-coding related
                  conversations, but I'm ready for your next coding question or
                  task!


                  Also, just a reminder, if you say the word "georgey," I will respond with "festivus." But let's focus on coding and development. How can I help you with your current project?
