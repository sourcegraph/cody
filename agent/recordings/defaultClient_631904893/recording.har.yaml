                  shared context into account in order to predict and suggest
                  high-quality code to complete the code enclosed in <CODE5711>
                  tags. You only response with code that works and fits
                  seamlessly with surrounding code if any or use best practice

                  Below is the code from file path src/sum.ts. Review the code
                  outside the XML tags to detect the functionality, formats,
                  style, patterns, and logics in use. Then, use what you detect
                  and reuse methods/libraries to complete and enclose completed
                  code only inside XML tags precisely without duplicating
                  existing implementations. Here is the code: 

                  ```

                  export function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
                     <CODE5711></CODE5711>
