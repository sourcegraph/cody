# Cody CLI

The Cody CLI documentation now lives in the official Sourcegraph docs https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody/clients/install-cli.

Historical context:
* The Cody CLI tool was originally called `cody-agent` but has now been renamed into just `cody`. The new npm package name is `@sourcegraph/cody` instead of the old `@sourcegraph/cody-agent`.
* The original `cody-agent experimental-cli` command is now just `cody`.
